pittetd
-------

This is an updated (read: unofficial, simplified) version of the University of
Pittsburgh's Electronic Theses and Dissertations intended for use under current
ETD specifications.

As of writing, both Overleaf and CTAN host wildly outdated (i.e. 20 years old)
versions of the ETD document. A scan through the provided `.dtx` and `.cls`
files, alongside a comparison of the files provided through the ETD website,
reveals:

- Essentially no meaningful changes in 20 years
- No updates to the _actual template source file_ (`pittetd.dtx` is used to
  generate `pittetd.cls`, yet only the `pittetd.cls` file was ever changed)
- Much of the template relies on outdated LaTeX, build systems, and gives
  unhelpful instructions in the documentation (`pittetd.pdf`).
- Even the template files supplied by ETD's website does not comply with the
  specifications ETD themselves lay out.

This repo offers a version of the `pittetd` LaTeX class which attempts to fix
the above issues (in particular, the last bullet point), while trimming down on
compatibility patches for packages (the `*.pit` files, again, generated by
`pittetd.dtx`)

# Usage

If you don't plan on making changes to the template, simply download a copy of
`pittetd.cls` and `an-etd.tex` (a demonstration LaTex document using the
`pittetd` class) and write your dissertation or thesis in `an-etd.tex`.
There's nothing special about its name, so you can also rename it if you'd like.

## Porting to an existing `.tex`

It might be possible to port your existing thesis/dissertation to use this class
file by simply overwriting `pittetd.cls`, but there are substantial changes to
how the class file actually gets used.
Therefore, I _strongly recommend_ copying your text, figures, graphs, etc. and any
other customization (in that order!) into `an-etd.tex`.

# Contributing

I'm not realistically going to maintain this, but pretending for a second that I
will...

If you want to contribute fixes and/or overhaul the package documentation, make
sure you:
1. Edit `pittetd.dtx` and use it to generate the documentation PDF, patch files,
   and class file (`pittetd.cls`).
   *Do not edit `pittetd.cls` or `.pit` files directly.*
2. Demonstrate your changes' needs or effects by adding a working example to
   `an-etd.tex` or add a new `*.tex` document demonstrating your feature/fix.
